# PCI Compliance & Data Storage in Stripe Integration

## Overview
When integrating Stripe into your website, you do **NOT** store credit card information in your system. Everything is handled by Stripe, which maintains PCI Level 1 compliance.

## Data Storage Responsibilities

### Your System Stores (Safe Data):
```
‚úÖ Safe to store:
- User ID: "user_12345"
- Stripe Customer ID: "cus_abc123xyz"
- Payment Method ID: "pm_1234567890" (token)
- Last 4 digits: "**** **** **** 1234"
- Card brand: "Visa"
- Expiry: "12/25"
- Payment status: "succeeded", "failed"
- Transaction amounts and dates
```

### Stripe Stores (Sensitive Data):
```
üîí Stripe handles securely:
- Full credit card numbers
- CVV codes
- Full cardholder data
- Encryption keys
- PCI compliance requirements
- Fraud detection data
```

## Secure Data Flow Process

1. **Card Entry**: Customer enters card details in Stripe.js (client-side)
2. **Tokenization**: Stripe.js immediately tokenizes card data before it reaches your server
3. **Token Storage**: Your system stores only the payment method token reference
4. **Future Payments**: You reference the token, Stripe processes with actual card data
5. **No Sensitive Data**: Credit card information never touches your servers

## PCI Compliance Benefits

### Stripe's PCI Level 1 Certification
- **Highest PCI compliance level** available
- **Annual security audits** and certifications
- **Industry-leading security** infrastructure
- **Continuous monitoring** and threat detection

### Your Reduced PCI Scope
- ‚úÖ **Minimized compliance burden** - you're not handling sensitive card data
- ‚úÖ **No expensive PCI audits** required for your system
- ‚úÖ **Reduced liability** - Stripe assumes responsibility for card security
- ‚úÖ **Lower compliance costs** - no PCI compliance fees or complex requirements

## Security Architecture

### Client-Side Security (Stripe.js)
- Card data encrypted before transmission
- Direct communication with Stripe servers
- No card data passes through your application
- Built-in fraud detection and validation

### Server-Side Security (Your Backend)
- Store only non-sensitive tokens and references
- Implement webhook signature verification
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Follow Stripe's security best practices

### Stripe's Security (External)
- End-to-end encryption of sensitive data
- Advanced fraud detection algorithms
- Secure tokenization and storage
- Regulatory compliance management

## Implementation Guidelines

### What You Should Do:
- ‚úÖ Store payment method tokens and customer references
- ‚úÖ Implement proper webhook verification
- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS for all communications
- ‚úÖ Follow secure coding practices
- ‚úÖ Regularly update Stripe SDK versions

### What You Should NOT Do:
- ‚ùå Store full credit card numbers
- ‚ùå Store CVV codes
- ‚ùå Log sensitive payment data
- ‚ùå Cache card information
- ‚ùå Transmit card data through your servers

## Compliance Checklist

### Technical Requirements:
- [ ] Use Stripe.js for card data collection
